# URL Bookmark Notes Plugin for SiYuan

Welcome to the **URL Bookmark Notes** for SiYuan! This plugin is designed to simplify the process of creating notes from URLs by automatically retrieving the title from a given URL and using it to create a new note. The specified URL is then included inside the note, and the note gets linked with a block reference automatically.

## Features

- **Retrieve Title from URL:** Automatically fetches the title of a webpage from a given URL.
- **Create New Note:** Creates a new note in SiYuan with the retrieved title as the note's title.
- **Include URL:** The specified URL is included inside the newly created note for easy reference.
- **Automatic Block Reference:** The plugin automatically inserts a block reference link to the created note.
- **Include the website content in the note:** Uses Mozilla's simplified readability mode to include a simplified version of the website in the note.
- **Support converting from pasting:** The plugin also allows to automatically convert the pasted URLs into notes.

## Usage

You can use the plugin with the slash menu (`/url`) or by using the specified keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+L`).

The plugin can also be used from the toolbar menu. In case there's a pre-existing selection, it will be used as document title.
